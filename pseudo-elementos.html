    <pre>
    Wyatt resteth here, that quick could never rest;
    Whose heavenly gifts increased by disdain,
    And virtue sank the deeper in his breast;
    Such profit he by envy could obtain.
    </pre>

    <pre>
    A head where wisdom mysteries did frame,
    Whose hammers beat still in that lively brain
    As on a stithy where that some work of fame
    Was daily wrought, to turn to Britain's gain.
    </pre>

    <pre>
    A visage stern and mild, where both did grow,
    Vice to contemn, in virtue to rejoice;
    Amid great storms, whom grace assured so
    To live upright and smile at fortune's choice.
    </pre>
